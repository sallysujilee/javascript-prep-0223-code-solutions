## Quiz Questions

After completing this exercise, you should be able to discuss or answer the following questions:

- What does `strictly equal` mean?

- What is the logical **and** operator?

- Can you name some comparison operators?

## Notes

All student notes should be written here.
1. Strict equality compares two values for equality. For example, if the values have different types, the vlaues are considered unequal, but if they have the same type, are not numbers, and have the same value, they're considered equal.

2. The logical && operator returns true if both operands are true and returns false otherwise.

3. Some examples of comparison operators are: == (equal to), != (not equal), <= (less than or equal to).
