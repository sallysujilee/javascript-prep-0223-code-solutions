  <h1>I would like to build</h1>
  <p> I came up with a few concepts on Figma - I want to make a cookbook app and a penpal app. <br>
    The cookbook is to help be a timer for those who forget to eat and/or those who don't know what to cook at home. <br>
    The penpal app is somethig similar to a game called Kind Words (on Steam). I want others to know that there are people out there willing to reach out to talk. For those who are lonely without friends, they can easily interact with others
    via the app. <br>
    A friend and I also attempted to make a recycling site - the proper way to separate and recycle, etc.</p>
